## P0 — Adoption Critical

1. ~~JSON interoperability~~ ✅ Complete

## P1 — Security / Rust Parity

1. **Rust implementation: apply Java's design changes**

   The Java implementation was refactored for SOLID principles. The Rust implementation needs
   the same treatment before the two diverge further.

   ### Step 1 — Command pattern for operation applicator

   * Current: large `match` / `if-let` chain in the operation applicator
   * Target: one handler type per `SchemaOperation` variant — a trait `RowOperationHandler`
     with `supports` + `apply`, and a `FieldResolutionHandler` trait for field-name shape changes
   * Registry: `OperationApplicator` holds a `Vec<Box<dyn RowOperationHandler>>` and dispatches

   ### Step 2 — Scope validators for derived-schema validation

   * Current: inline `match` in `validateWithParent` / equivalent Rust function
   * Target: `OperationScopeValidator` trait, one struct per operation type, orchestrated by `ScopeValidation::validate`

   ### ~~Step 3 — ASCON-128a field cipher + ECDH DEK wrapping (Rust)~~ ✅ Complete

   * Implemented via `ascon-aead` crate (RustCrypto family)
   * All 3 algorithms (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, ASCON-128a) × 2 KEK modes (RSA, ECDH) working

   ### ~~Step 4 — EcdhCryptoConfig `ofKeys` equivalent (Rust)~~ ✅ Complete

   * `EcdhCryptoConfig::of_keys(peer_pub_der: Vec<u8>, host_priv_pem: &str)` added
   * Enables in-process testing without environment setup

   ### ~~Step 5 — Wire compatibility tests~~ ✅ Complete

   * Crypto layer: `code/cross-compat/fixtures/` — 4 committed fixture files (RSA + ECDH × Rust + Java)
   * Full stream: `code/cross-compat/rust-encrypted.jsont` + `java-encrypted.jsont` — 10 rows each, verified bidirectionally
   * `EncryptHeader` round-trip, per-field payload structure, SHA-256 digest verification — all confirmed

   ### Important: apply SOLID principles throughout

   The user confirmed that SOLID principles and appropriate design patterns are the standard
   for this codebase. When touching Rust code, apply the same command/strategy patterns
   as the Java refactor. Do not use large match blocks as the sole structure for extensible logic.

## P2 — Data Capabilities

1. **Nested field path resolution for all derived-schema operations**

   ### Problem
   The grammar allows dot-separated field paths (`address.city`, `member.name.first`) in all
   derived-schema operations. Both implementations silently fail to resolve them — each in a
   different, inconsistent way:

   | Operation | Rust (`path.join()`) | Java (`path.leaf()`) |
   |---|---|---|
   | `project(a.b)` | looks up key `"a.b"` → `FieldNotFound` | looks up key `"b"` → may accidentally match a top-level field named `"b"` |
   | `exclude(a.b)` | looks up key `"a.b"` → `FieldNotFound` | looks up key `"b"` → same accidental match risk |
   | `rename(a.b as c)` | looks up key `"a.b"` → `FieldNotFound` | looks up key `"b"` → accidental match |
   | `filter a.b > 0` | `EvalContext` has no key `"a.b"` → `UnboundField` | `FieldRefCollector` collects `leaf()="b"`, EvalContext has no `"b"` → `UnboundField` |
   | `transform c = a.b * 2` | looks up `"a.b"` in EvalContext → `UnboundField` | looks up `"b"` in EvalContext → `UnboundField` |
   | `decrypt(a.b)` | looks up field name `"a.b"` → `FieldNotFound` | field names are plain `String`, looks up `"a.b"` → `FieldNotFound` |

   **Root cause:** The working row in both implementations is a flat structure
   (`Vec<(String, JsonTValue)>` in Rust, `LinkedHashMap<String, JsonTValue>` in Java)
   keyed by the parent schema's own top-level field names only. No operation descends into
   `JsonTValue::Object` / `JsonTValue.Object` values to extract nested fields.

   **Java diverges from Rust:** Java uses `path.leaf()` throughout — the last segment only —
   while Rust uses `path.join()` — the full dot-joined string. Both are wrong for nested paths
   but in different ways: Java's approach can silently produce incorrect results if a top-level
   field happens to share the leaf name.

   ### Required changes (both implementations)

   **Step 1 — Flatten-on-entry (simpler, immediate)**
   When entering `apply_operations`, if the working row contains `Object`-typed values,
   optionally flatten them depth-first into the working map using dot-joined keys:
   `("address", Object([("city", "NYC"), ("zip", "10001")]))` →
   `("address.city", "NYC"), ("address.zip", "10001")`.
   All operations then work uniformly on the flat map. Re-nest on exit if needed.
   Risk: information loss if two nested schemas have identically named leaf fields at different
   paths — requires a collision policy.

   **Step 2 — Path-aware lookup (correct, more complex)**
   Change all handlers to resolve dot paths by descending into the `Object` value tree:
   `resolve(working, ["address", "city"])` → get `working["address"]` → get `.city` from
   that Object. Each handler needs a `get_nested(path)` / `set_nested(path, value)` helper.
   This is the correct design — paths retain their full semantics, no collision risk, no
   re-nesting pass required.

   **Step 3 — Grammar validation at parse/build time**
   Once runtime handles paths, the schema builder/parser must also validate that dot paths
   reference fields that actually exist in the parent schema at their declared depth.
   Currently `DecryptScopeValidator` (Rust) explicitly defers this check (`// deferred`).
   All scope validators need path-aware field resolution.

   ### Consistency fix needed now (before full implementation)
   Java must switch all `path.leaf()` calls to `path.dotJoined()` to match Rust's `path.join()`
   behaviour and eliminate the silent-wrong-match risk. This is a one-line change per handler
   and makes both implementations fail consistently (`FieldNotFound`) on nested paths
   rather than Java accidentally succeeding with the wrong field.

## P3 — Platform Evolution

1. Runtime engine design
2. Playground / developer experience

## Notes

* Prioritize adoption over new abstractions
* Avoid moving to runtime before core adoption stabilizes
* jsont-crypto wire format is frozen by design — changes require a new `format_ver` bit
* ECDH host public key: the current ECDH implementation is mathematically correct — the host
  public key is implicit in the private key. Including peer public key bytes in HKDF info
  is a future security enhancement for stronger key binding, not a correctness fix.
